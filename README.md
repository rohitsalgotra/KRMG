Kepler Red Meerkat Grey Algorithm.
This algorithm is based on the multi-hybrid properties of Kepler optimization algorithm (KOA), red panda optimizer (RPO), meerkat optimizer (MO) and grey wolf optimizer (GWO).
The proposed algorithm is applied to CEC 2014, CEC 2017, CEC 2019 and CEC 2022 benchmark problems for experimental and statistical relevance.
It has been applied to six constrained engineering design problems, and for the parametric estimation of proton exchange memberane fuel cells (PEMFCs).
Here we are providing the dataset and results associated with out publication.
Detailed source-codes are under preperation and will be added soon...
